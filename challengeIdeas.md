Challenge Ideas

Here are some beginner-level React challenge ideas based on the outlined prerequisites and scope:
Basic Component Structure and Props:

    Create a simple component: Build a component that renders a heading, paragraph, and an image.
    Pass props to a component: Create a reusable component that displays different content based on props passed to it.
    Nested components: Create a component hierarchy with parent and child components, passing data through props.

State Management:

    Toggle state: Create a component with a button that toggles state to show or hide content.
    Controlled components: Build a simple form with input fields that update state on change.
    Lifting state up: Create a parent component to manage the state for multiple child components.

Event Handling:

    Click event: Create a button that triggers a function when clicked.
    Form submission: Build a simple form that collects user input and submits it (e.g., using preventDefault).
    Conditional rendering based on events: Show or hide content based on user interaction.

Lists and Keys:

    Render a list of items: Create a component that displays a list of items from an array.
    Using keys: Demonstrate the importance of using keys in lists to prevent performance issues.
    Conditional rendering within a list: Show different content for specific list items.

Component Lifecycle:

    Mounting and unmounting: Show how to perform actions when a component mounts or unmounts (e.g., setting up timers, cleaning up subscriptions).
    Updating: Demonstrate how to update a component when props or state change.

Additional Considerations:

    Difficulty levels: You can create different versions of each challenge with varying levels of complexity.
    Code scaffolding: Provide basic code structure for each challenge to help users get started.
    Hints and solutions: Offer hints or solutions for users who get stuck.
    Interactive testing: Consider using a testing framework like Jest to provide automated feedback on challenge solutions.
