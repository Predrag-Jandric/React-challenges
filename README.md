Prequisites: Beginner React understanding !
Scope: We will be solving mostly beginner level challenges 

To get the most out of these challenges, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of JSX, components, state, and props. But even if you are not sure about these concepts, it will still provide good example explanations.


You will be working in your local environment, you are free to use "create-react-app", "vite" or any other way of creating a project. If you are familiar with any other languages such as Typescript or Next.js or styling languages, you are free to experiment. I am just here to provide opportunity in a structured way. Also, If you are familiar with Git, you can create repositories for each challenge and push commits to it. 

- Follow the instruction closely, everything is explained
